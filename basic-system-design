As a Senior Engineer with over 12 years of experience, I can tell you quite certainly that if you're still getting rejections in system design interviews after good efforts, I think your fundamentals are not strong...

Dedicate 4-8 weeks to mastering these design fundamentals, then practice designing few systems(instead of mock interviews).
